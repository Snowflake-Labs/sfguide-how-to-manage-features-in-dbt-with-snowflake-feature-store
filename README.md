# Getting Started with Feature Store and dbt

## Overview
This notebook demonstrates the integration between dbt and Snowflake Feature Store. The source data is managed within a Snowflake database, while the feature pipelines are orchestrated and executed using dbt. The resulting feature tables are stored in Snowflake. We then read from these feature tables, register them as Feature Views, and build ML Datasets.
